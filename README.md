# Boilerplate Project

A boilerplate project created in flutter using MobX and Provider.

## Getting Started

The Boilerplate contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using boiler plate code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.

### Boilerplate Features:

* Splash
* Login
* Home
* Routing
* Theme
* Dio
* Database
* MobX (to connect the reactive data of your application with the UI)
* Provider (State Management)
* Encryption
* Validation
* Code Generation
* User Notifications
* Logging

### Libraries & Tools Used

* [Dio](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio)
* [Database](https://github.com/tekartik/sembast.dart)
* [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx.dart) (to connect the reactive data of your application with the UI)
* [Provider](https://github.com/rrousselGit/provider) (State Management)
* [Encryption](https://github.com/xxtea/xxtea-dart)
* [Validation](https://github.com/dart-league/validators)
* [Logging](https://github.com/zubairehman/Flogs)
* [Notifications](https://github.com/AndreHaueisen/flushbar)
* [Json Serialization](https://github.com/dart-lang/json_serializable)

### MobX

MobX is a battle tested, simple and scalable state management library transparently applying functional reactive programming. The Mobx design principle is very simple:

Anything that can be derived from the application state, should be derived. Automatically.

This includes the UI, data serialization, server communication, etc

You can read more about mobx from the following link:

### Provider

A dependency injection system built with widgets for widgets. provider is mostly syntax sugar for InheritedWidget, to make common use-cases straightforward.

#### Exposing a value
To expose a variable using provider, wrap any widget into one of the provider widgets from this package and pass it your variable. Then, all descendants of the newly added provider widget can access this variable.

A simple example would be to wrap the entire application into a Provider widget and pass it our variable:

```
Provider<Foo>.value(
  value: foo,
  child: someWidget,
)
```

#### Reading a value
The easiest way to read a value is by using the static method Provider.of<T>(BuildContext context). This method will look up in widget tree starting from the widget associated with the BuildContext passed and it will return the nearest variable of type T found (or throw if nothing if found).

Combined with the first example of exposing a value, this widget will read the exposed String and render "Hello World."

```
class Home extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(
      /// Don't forget to pass the type of the object you want to obtain to `Provider.of`!
      Provider.of<Foo>(context)
    );
  }
}
```

Alternatively instead of using Provider.of, we can use the Consumer widget.

This can be useful for performance optimizations or when it is difficult to obtain a BuildContext descendant of the provider.
```
Center(
  child: Consumer<Foo>(
    builder: (context, value, child) => Text(value),
  ),
);
```

### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- constants/
|- data/
|- stores/
|- ui/
|- utils/
|- widgets/
|- main.dart
|- routes.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- constants - All the application level constants are defined in this directory with-in their respective files. This directory contains the constants for `theme`, `dimentions`, `api endpoints`, `preferences` and `strings`.
2- data - Contains the data layer of your project, includes directories for local, network and shared pref/cache.
3- stores - Contains store(s) for state-management of your application, to connect the reactive data of your application with the UI. 
4- ui‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains all the ui of your project, contains sub directory for each screen.
5- util‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains the utilities/common functions of your application.
6- widgets‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains the common widgets for your applications. For example, Button, TextField etc.
7- routes.dart‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThis file contains all the routes for your application.
8- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.
```

### Constants

This directory contains all the application level constants. A separate file is created for each type as shown in example below:

```
constants/
|- app_theme.dart
|- dimens.dart
|- endpoints.dart
|- preferences.dart
|- strings.dart
```

### Data

All the business logic of your application will go into this directory, it represents the data layer of your application. It is sub-divided into three directories `local`, `network` and `shared_perf`, each containing the domain specific logic. Since each layer exists independently, that makes it easier to unit test. The communication between UI and data layer is handled by using central repository.

```
data/
|- local/
    |- constants/
    |- datasouces/
    |- app_database.dart
   
|- network/
    |- constants/
    |- exceptions/
    |- rest_client.dart
    
|- sharedpref
    |- constants/
    |- shared_preference_helper.dart
    
|- repository.dart

```

### Stores

The store is where all your application state lives in flutter. The Store is basically a widget that stands at the top of the widget tree and passes it's data down using special methods. In-case of multiple stores, a separate folder for each store is created as shown in the example below:

```
stores/
|- login/
    |- login_store.dart
    |- form_validator.dart
```

### UI

This directory contains all the ui of your application. Each screen is located in a separate folder making it easy to combine group of files related to that particular screen. All the screen specific widgets will be placed in `widgets` directory as shown in the example below:

```
ui/
|- login
   |- login_screen.dart
   |- widgets
      |- login_form.dart
      |- login_button.dart
```

### Utils

Contains the common file(s) and utilities used in a project. The folder structure is as follows: 

```
utils/
|- encryption
   |- xxtea.dart
|- date
  |- date_time.dart
```

### Widgets

Contains the common widgets that are shared across multiple screens. For example, Button, TextField etc.

```
widgets/
|- app_icon_widget.dart
|- empty_app_bar.dart
|- progress_indicator.dart
```

### Routes

This file contains all the routes for your application.

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'ui/home/home.dart';
import 'ui/login/login.dart';
import 'ui/splash/splash.dart';

class Routes {
  Routes._();

  //static variables
  static const String splash = '/splash';
  static const String login = '/login';
  static const String home = '/home';

  static final routes = <String, WidgetBuilder>{
    splash: (BuildContext context) => SplashScreen(),
    login: (BuildContext context) => LoginScreen(),
    home: (BuildContext context) => HomeScreen(),
  };
}
```

### Main

This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.

```
import 'package:boilerplate/routes.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

import 'constants/app_theme.dart';
import 'constants/strings.dart';
import 'ui/splash/splash.dart';

void main() {
  SystemChrome.setPreferredOrientations([
    DeviceOrientation.portraitUp,
    DeviceOrientation.portraitDown,
    DeviceOrientation.landscapeRight,
    DeviceOrientation.landscapeLeft,
  ]).then((_) {
    runApp(MyApp());
  });
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: Strings.appName,
      theme: themeData,
      routes: Routes.routes,
      home: SplashScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have on this approach, and if you want to lend a hand with the boilerplate then please feel free to submit an issue and/or pull request üôÇ

Again to note, this is example can appear as over-architectured for what it is - but it is an example only. If you liked my work, don‚Äôt forget to ‚≠ê star the repo to show your support.
